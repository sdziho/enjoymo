                                <p><b>The Ottomans</b> used monumental architecture to affirm, expand, and consolidate their estates. Ottoman architecture has transformed the city with its development, and even today the largest number of national monuments and the most beautiful buildings are in Ottoman architecture. Mosques characterized the Ottoman-ruled areas, and in addition to mosques there were madrasas, baths, hammams, kiraethans, mektebs, markets, divanhans and other buildings, and the city is grateful to the Ottomans for the first waterworks and public fountains. The dome represents the presence of the Ottomans in the territories they controlled and also signified the Ottoman rule over the territory and benevolence towards the local population. The one-story and two-story houses were mostly with large walls around the courtyard, but rich and picturesque inside. Each was carefully located to have a view of a cypress or minaret from a window on the second floor and none was legally allowed to block the view of a neighbor. The entrance from the street led to the courtyard (courtyard), which created a passage that allowed intimacy and privacy inside the house; rooms intended for family life were separated from those for receiving guests.
                                <br><br>In Mostar, architectural styles reflected cosmopolitan interest and exposure to foreign aesthetic trends and were skillfully blended with domestic styles. Examples include the Franciscan Church in the Italianized style, the Ottoman Muslibegović House, the Dalmatian Ćorović House and the Orthodox Church built as a gift from the Sultan.</p>

                            <p>The Austro-Hungarian occupation of Bosnia and Herzegovina in 1878 caused the Mostar City Council to strive for autonomy, but cooperated with Austro-Hungary to implement urban planning reforms: wide avenues and an urban network were built on the west bank of the Neretva, and there were significant investments. in infrastructure, communications and households.
                                The change of government in August 1878 brought a lively urban development to Mostar. With considerable capital invested, the City Council began to implement extensive reforms in urban planning. The new government imagined that the city's past and present would remain on the east bank of the Neretva, and that the west bank would be intended for its future.
                                In the first years of the Austro-Hungarian administration, the construction of a new water supply system was completed (1885), the city sewerage and electricity network, and the streets were given lighting, all in a relatively short time.
                            </p>
                            <p>City administrators, such as Mujaga Komadina, played a central role in these changes, which boosted the city’s growth and connected its east and west sides.
                                The building of the Gymnasium was built in 1902 in the pseudo-Moorish style and today it has been renovated and adorns the city with an authentic look.
                                The new monuments and architectural styles reflected the aspirations of the people of Mostar and the Austro-Hungarian administration. Monolithic Neo-Renaissance buildings rose above the smaller Ottoman ones, bringing the city high “street” walls. The new buildings symbolized prosperity, stability and tradition, connecting Mostar with other European centers, and affirmed Western influence, which complemented traditional Ottoman buildings.
                                The inevitable hybrid that emerged in this period of intensive construction was a new, monumental style that combined European prototypes with Orientalist details, particularly with regard to structures built in the pseudo-Moorish style. A good illustration of this is the Mostar Gymnasium building. Although its design is derived from Islamic styles in Spain and North Africa and has no real connection to Mostar's Ottoman past, it reflects the Austro-Hungarian administration's tendency to harmonize cultural differences within the monarchy. The city spa was also built in a similar style.

                            <p>The architecture of modernism that is developing after Austro-Hungary is the era of the domination of the modern movement in European architecture, whose supporters show a significant deviation from tradition and ornament in architecture. In that period, the ideas of healthy functionalism prevailed, which advocated a harmonious synthesis of content and form, especially in the culture of housing, in unity with the results of technical progress.
                                In the Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia, about 15,000 monuments dedicated to the People's Liberation War were erected on the sites of significant historical battles from the Second World War or on the sites of great suffering of civilians and fighters, the most significant being the Partisan Memorial in Mostar.
                                Mostar was completely destroyed in the subsequent aggression, and after the end of the aggression, most of the buildings were renovated in their authentic appearance, after which the oldest buildings were protected as national monuments. Today, Mostar is like a postcard and an open-air museum. In terms of architecture, Mostar today is a combination of many cultures, traditions and modern style.
